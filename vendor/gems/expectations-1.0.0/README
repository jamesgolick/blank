= expectations

expectations is a lightweight unit testing framework. Tests (expectations) can be written as follows 

  expect 2 do 
    1 + 1 
  end 

  expect NoMethodError do 
    Object.invalid_method_call 
  end.

expectations is designed to encourage unit testing best practices such as
  - discourage setting more than one expectation at a time
  - promote maintainability by not providing a setup or teardown method
  - provide one syntax for setting up state based or behavior based expectation
  - focus on readability by providing no mechanism for describing an expectation other than the code in the expectation.

Mocking is done utilizing Mocha[http://mocha.rubyforge.org]

== TextMate

The following code can be used as a new command in TextMate for running an individual expectation.

== Usage

expectations can be used for state based and behavior based testing.

	require File.dirname(__FILE__) + "/test_helper"
	
	Expectations do
	  
	  # State based expectation where a value equals another value
	  expect 2 do
	    1 + 1
	  end
	  
	  # State based expectation where an exception is expected. Simply expect the Class of the intended exception
	  expect NoMethodError do
	    Object.no_method
	  end
	  
	  # Behavior based test using a traditional mock
	  expect mock.to.receive(:dial).with("2125551212").times(2) do |phone|
	    phone.dial("2125551212")
	    phone.dial("2125551212")
	  end
	
	  # Behavior based test using a stub
	  expect stub.to.receive(:dial).with("2125551212").times(2) do |phone|
	    phone.dial("2125551212")
	    phone.dial("2125551212")
	  end
	
	  # Behavior based test using a stub_everything
	  expect stub_everything.to.receive(:dial).with("2125551212").times(2) do |phone|
	    phone.dial("2125551212")
	    phone.dial("2125551212")
	  end
	
	  # Behavior based test on a concrete mock
	  expect Object.to.receive(:deal) do
	    Object.deal
	  end
	  
	  # State based test utilizing a stub
	  expect 2 do
	    stub(:two => 2).two
	  end
	  
	  # State based test utilizing a concrete mock
	  expect 2 do
	    Object.expects(:bar).returns 2
	    Object.bar
	  end
	  
	  # Behavior based test utilizing a stub and a concrete mock
	  expect 1 do
	    Object.expects(:give_me_three).with(3).returns 1
	    Object.give_me_three(stub(:three=>3).three)
	  end
	  
	  # State based test matching a Regexp
	  expect /a string/ do
	    "a string"
	  end
	  
	  # State based test checking if actual is in the expected Range
	  expect 1..5 do
	    3
	  end
	  
	  # State based test to determine if the object is an instance of the module
	  expect Enumerable do
	    []
	  end
	
	  # State based test to determine if the object is an instance of the class
	  expect String do
	    "a string"
	  end
	  
	  # State based test to determine if the modules are the same
	  expect Enumerable do
	    Enumerable
	  end
	  
	  # State based test to determine if the classes are the same
	  expect String do
	    String
	  end
	  
	  # State based test with XML strings, whitespace between tags is ignored
	  expect xml("<a><foo>bar</foo></a>") do
	    "<a>\n\t<foo>bar</foo>  \n</a>"
	  end
	  
	  # State based test with XML strings, whitespace between tags is ignored
	  expect xml(<<-eos) do
	    <one>
	      <two>
	        <three>4</three>
	        <five> 6 </five>
	      </two>
	    </one>
	    eos
	    "<one><two><three>4</three>
	      <five> 6 </five>
	    </two></one>"
	  end
	
	  # this is normally defined in the file specific to the class
	  klass = Class.new do
	    def save(arg)
	      record.save(arg)
	    end
	  end
	  # State based delegation test
	  expect klass.new.to.delegate(:save).to(:record) do |instance|
	    instance.save(1)
	  end
	  
	  # this is normally defined in the file specific to the class
	  klass = Class.new do
	    attr_accessor :started
	  end
	  # State based fluent interface boolean test using to be
	  expect klass.new.to.be.started do |process|
	    process.started = true
	  end
	  
	  # this is normally defined in the file specific to the class
	  klass = Class.new do
	    attr_accessor :finished
	  end
	  # State based fluent interface boolean test using to have
	  expect klass.new.to.have.finished do |process|
	    process.finished = true
	  end
